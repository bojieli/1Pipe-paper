\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The ordering of events and messages is fundamental to many distributed systems.
Leveraging programmable data center networks, we propose the principle of separate the bookkeeping of order information from the forwarding of data packets.
We design and implement \sys to achieve distributed total ordering with scalability, efficiency and fault tolerance.
With cheaper total ordering, we expect future data center applications to enjoy higher consistency without sacrificing performance.
