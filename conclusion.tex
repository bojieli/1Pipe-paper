\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The ordering of events and messages is fundamental to many distributed systems.
Leveraging programmable data center networks, we propose a total order communication abstraction, \sys{}, that separates the bookkeeping of order information from the forwarding of data packets.
\sys{} simplifies design and improves performance of transactional key-value stores, independent transactions, log replication, and distributed data structures.
%We design and implement \sys to achieve linearizable and serializable message scattering with scalability, efficiency and fault tolerance.
%Programmable data center networks make modern data centers resemble a warehouse-scale computer more than a traditional distributed system.
With cheaper total ordering, we expect future data center applications to enjoy higher consistency without sacrificing performance.
