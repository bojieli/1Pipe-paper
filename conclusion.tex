\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

%The ordering of events and messages is fundamental to many distributed systems.
We propose a causal and total order communication abstraction, \sys{}, that delivers messages in sender's clock time order and provides restricted failure atomicity. 
\sys{} achieves scalability and efficiency by utilizing programmable data center networks to separate bookkeeping order information from forwarding data packets.
\sys{} can simplify and accelerate many applications, and we expect future work to explore more. %transactional key-value stores, independent transactions, distributed data structures, and log replication.
One limitation of \sys{} is that lossy links or bad clocks slow down the whole system, so, a separate \sys{} instance should be deployed for each cluster or service.
%We expect more applications to exploit total ordering of events and messages.
%We design and implement \sys to achieve linearizable and serializable message scattering with scalability, efficiency and fault tolerance.
%Programmable data center networks make modern data centers resemble a warehouse-scale computer more than a traditional distributed system.
%We expect more applications to leverage \sys{}'s total ordering and enjoy higher consistency without sacrificing performance.
